They have also launched some affordable devices in the market with the cheapest one priced at Rs. 3000 (LYF Flame). VoLTE, on the other hand, is the voice network Jio is delivering to users. The SIM cards will not be different, but the band on which they operate will be different. VoLTE stands for Voice Over LTE and it’s like taking calls in high definition which is done on a 4G network when compared to Airtel, Vodafone and other networks which are still utilizing the 3G/2G network for calls. One more advantage of VoLTE is that you will be able to access the internet on the phone even while you are on a call."],
